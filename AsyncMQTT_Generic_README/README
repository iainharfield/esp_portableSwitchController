To avoid compilation errors for different board types

To compile on ESP8266 D1 Mini I have to manually edit the AsyncMQTT_Generic library.json file so
that the dependency files are the ones compatible with my board.

When installing the AsyncMQTT_Generic replace the library.son file with this one.

I dont really understand why I have to do this.
